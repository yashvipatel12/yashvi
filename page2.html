    <strong>Chole bhature is a popular North Indian dish consisting of two main components:</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>Chole: This refers to spicy chickpeas cooked in a tangy tomato-based gravy. The chickpeas (also known as garbanzo beans) are typically soaked overnight and then cooked with onions, tomatoes, ginger, garlic, and a blend of spices such as cumin, coriander, turmeric, and garam masala. The dish often includes amchur (dry mango powder) or anardana (pomegranate seed powder) to add a sour note.

        </li>
        <li>Bhature: These are deep-fried bread made from a fermented dough of all-purpose flour (maida), yogurt, oil, and sometimes a pinch of baking soda. The dough is kneaded well and left to ferment for a few hours, which gives the bhature its characteristic texture and flavor. After fermentation, small portions of dough are rolled into flat discs and deep-fried until they puff up and turn golden brown.</li>

    <strong>Rajma-chawal is a popular North Indian dish consisting of two main components:</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>Rajma: Rajma refers to red kidney beans, which are soaked overnight and then cooked with onions, tomatoes, ginger, garlic, and a blend of spices. Common spices used include cumin, coriander, turmeric, and garam masala. This mixture is simmered until the kidney beans are tender and flavorful. Some variations include adding yogurt or cream to the gravy for richness.</li>
        <li>Chawal: Chawal is the Hindi word for rice. Basmati rice is typically used for rajma chawal due to its fragrance and texture. The rice is cooked separately by boiling it until itâ€™s fluffy and each grain is distinct.</li>
